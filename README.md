# Violent Python Exercises  
This repository focuses on proposing new solutions for the exercises in the book Violent Python, A cookbook for hackers, Penetration Testers, and Security Engineers by TJ. O'Connor. ISBN: 978-1-59749-957-6

A comparison between the book's solution and my proposed solution will be shown with the objective of determining which is the most efficient in terms of memory usage and performance.

This is presented as a learning exercise, please refer to the **LICENSE** file in this repository for licensing and usage questions, applicable to the code created by me, only.

Finally, I'd like to thank TJ O'Connor for writing the Violent Python Book, which has been an important piece in career.  

By presenting this work I'm merely trying to apply new concepts to an already amazing work.
